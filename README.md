After a recent wave of inspiration, I decided to try to make another E-commerce site, but this one will be about consoles and PCs rather than clothing. I want to see how much I have improved as a Web Developer over the recent months. This readme file will contain all the updates I have made to the site and images pretaining every major update.

Latest Update: (January 16th, 2022)
-Changed the navigation bar: Removed Catalog and changed Account text to logo
-Added a show all button for the top category filters.
-Added filter functionality by making it so when a category is active, it will show the corresponding elements and when it is not active, the elements are hidden.
-Added 4 products, PS5, Box X, Switch and PC, and then buttons for adding to cart and more information. 
-Not complete, but adding mobile support where add cart and information text buttons will change to logos to save space. (The components are squished together on mobile and will need to change the layout sizes that work better for mobile)


Previous Update: (January 15th, 2022)
-Already went through 3 UI changes, 1 was a banner of different consoles that would change every few seconds, 2 was a categories bar with the name and the logo of the company, and 3 is just the logo with the colors adjusted for each brand, I have chosen 3 after testing all 3.
-The cetegories will have effects on hover where they slide up and enlarge to show they are being hovered over. This behaviour will be improved on in the later updates.
-The navigation bar is also not final as there might be additions or further changes to it. I uses a Bootstrap icon as the shopping cart and the number on top will change according to the items that are added to the cart.
