After a recent wave of inspiration, I decided to try to make another E-commerce site, but this one will be about consoles and PCs rather than clothing. I want to see how much I have improved as a Web Developer over the recent months. This readme file will contain all the updates I have made to the site and images pretaining every major update.

Latest Update: (January 15th, 2022)
-Already went through 3 UI changes, 1 was a banner of different consoles that would change every few seconds, 2 was a categories bar with the name and the logo of the company, and 3 is just the logo with the colors adjusted for each brand, I have chosen 3 after testing all 3.
-The cetegories will have effects on hover where they slide up and enlarge to show they are being hovered over. This behaviour will be improved on in the later updates.
-The navigation bar is also not final as there might be additions or further changes to it. I uses a Bootstrap icon as the shopping cart and the number on top will change according to the items that are added to the cart.
